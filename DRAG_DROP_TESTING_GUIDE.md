# üß™ Drag & Drop Testing Guide

## üéØ **Comprehensive Debug System Deployed**

I've implemented a complete debugging and testing system to help identify exactly what's happening with the drag-and-drop functionality.

## üîß **What's Been Added**

### 1. **Real-time Debug Logging**
- Every drag-and-drop action is logged with timestamps
- Detailed information about drag start, drag over, and drag end events
- API call logging for assignment creation
- Error tracking and validation logging

### 2. **Debug Panel**
- Click the **"Debug"** button in the header to open the debug panel
- View real-time logs of all drag-and-drop activities
- Export logs to a text file for analysis
- Clear logs to start fresh

### 3. **Automated Test Suite**
- Comprehensive test suite that simulates drag-and-drop operations
- Tests all validation logic
- Checks assignment type validation
- Verifies data structure integrity

## üöÄ **How to Test**

### **Step 1: Access the Application**
1. Go to: http://localhost:3001
2. Login with any account:
   - **Admin**: `admin` / `admin`
   - **Editor**: `editor` / `editor` 
   - **Viewer**: `viewer` / `viewer`

### **Step 2: Enable Debug Mode**
1. Click the **"Debug"** button in the header
2. The debug panel will appear showing:
   - Real-time logs
   - Current application state
   - Drag state information

### **Step 3: Run Automated Tests**
1. In the debug panel, scroll down to the **"Drag & Drop Test Suite"**
2. Click **"Run Tests"** to execute automated tests
3. Review the test results to see what's working and what's failing

### **Step 4: Manual Testing**
1. Try to drag a doctor from the right sidebar
2. Watch the debug logs in real-time
3. Try to drop the doctor into a schedule cell
4. Check the logs for any errors or issues

## üìä **What to Look For**

### **In the Debug Logs:**
- **"Drag started"** - Should show doctor ID and name
- **"Drag over"** - Should show when hovering over cells
- **"Drag ended"** - Should show drop target information
- **"Processing drop"** - Should show parsed data
- **"Creating assignment"** - Should show API call data
- **"Assignment created successfully"** - Should confirm success

### **Common Issues to Check:**
1. **No drag start**: Doctor cards not draggable
2. **No drag over**: Cells not accepting drops
3. **Invalid assignment type**: Wrong enum values
4. **API errors**: Network or server issues
5. **Validation failures**: Capacity or double-booking checks

## üîç **Debugging Steps**

### **If Drag Doesn't Start:**
1. Check if doctor cards have the draggable cursor
2. Look for "Drag started" log entry
3. Verify doctor data is loaded correctly

### **If Drop Doesn't Work:**
1. Check if cells highlight when hovering
2. Look for "Drag over" log entries
3. Check "Drag ended" logs for drop target data

### **If Assignment Creation Fails:**
1. Check "Creating assignment" log entry
2. Look for API error messages
3. Verify schedule ID exists
4. Check assignment data structure

## üìÅ **Exporting Debug Data**

### **Export Logs:**
1. Click **"Export Logs"** in the debug panel
2. Download the text file with all log entries
3. Share the file for analysis

### **Export Test Results:**
1. Run the automated test suite
2. Click **"Export"** in the test suite
3. Download JSON file with detailed test results

## üéØ **Expected Behavior**

### **Successful Drag & Drop:**
1. **Drag Start**: Doctor card becomes semi-transparent
2. **Drag Over**: Schedule cell highlights in blue
3. **Drop**: Doctor appears in the cell
4. **Save**: Assignment is created and persisted

### **Debug Log Flow:**
```
[timestamp] Drag started: {"doctorId": "1", "doctorName": "Dr. Ahmed Hassan"}
[timestamp] Drag over: {"activeId": "1", "overId": "2024-01-01_ultrasound_morning"}
[timestamp] Drag ended: {"activeId": "1", "overId": "2024-01-01_ultrasound_morning"}
[timestamp] Processing drop: {"doctorId": 1, "cellData": "2024-01-01_ultrasound_morning"}
[timestamp] Parsed drop data: {"dateStr": "2024-01-01", "assignmentType": "ultrasound_morning"}
[timestamp] Creating assignment: {"doctor_id": 1, "assignment_date": "2024-01-01", "assignment_type": "ultrasound_morning"}
[timestamp] Assignment created successfully: {"assignmentId": 1, "doctorName": "Dr. Ahmed Hassan"}
```

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **If Nothing Happens:**
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify all services are running: `docker compose ps`
3. Check API health: http://localhost:8001/health

### **If Drag Works But Drop Fails:**
1. Check assignment type validation in logs
2. Verify schedule exists
3. Check capacity limits
4. Look for API errors

### **If API Calls Fail:**
1. Check network tab in browser dev tools
2. Verify API endpoints are accessible
3. Check authentication token
4. Review API logs: `docker compose logs api`

## üìû **Next Steps**

1. **Run the tests** and check the debug logs
2. **Try manual drag-and-drop** and watch the logs
3. **Export the debug data** if issues persist
4. **Share the logs** for further analysis

The debug system will capture exactly what's happening at each step, making it easy to identify where the drag-and-drop process is failing.

**üéØ Goal**: Use this comprehensive debugging system to identify exactly where the drag-and-drop functionality is breaking down, then we can fix the specific issue.
