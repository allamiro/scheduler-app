# üîç CLIENT-SIDE ERROR DEBUGGING GUIDE

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ All services are healthy and running
- ‚úÖ API authentication works perfectly
- ‚úÖ Database is properly configured
- ‚úÖ Build process completes successfully
- ‚ùå Client-side JavaScript error occurs

## üß™ Step-by-Step Debugging Process

### Step 1: Test Basic Functionality
**Go to: `http://localhost:3001/simple-test`**
- This tests basic React functionality and API connection
- If this works, the issue is with complex components
- If this fails, the issue is with basic setup

### Step 2: Test Minimal Dashboard
**Go to: `http://localhost:3001/minimal-dashboard`**
- This tests authentication and basic dashboard functionality
- If this works, the issue is with Swapy or error logger
- If this fails, the issue is with authentication/API

### Step 3: Test Swapy Implementation
**Go to: `http://localhost:3001/test-swapy`**
- This tests the Swapy drag-and-drop library in isolation
- If this works, Swapy is not the issue
- If this fails, Swapy is causing the problem

### Step 4: Test Original Drag-and-Drop
**Go to: `http://localhost:3001/test-drag`**
- This tests the original @dnd-kit implementation
- Compare with Swapy to identify the issue

### Step 5: Test Main Dashboard
**Go to: `http://localhost:3001/dashboard`**
- This is the full implementation with all components
- Use browser developer tools to see the exact error

## üîß Debugging Tools Available

### 1. Comprehensive Logging Script
```bash
# Check all service logs
./debug-logs.sh all

# Follow real-time logs
./debug-logs.sh follow api

# Check service health
./debug-logs.sh health

# Test API endpoints
./debug-logs.sh test
```

### 2. Browser Developer Tools
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for JavaScript errors
4. Check Network tab for failed requests

### 3. Frontend Error Logger
- Available in the debug panel on the dashboard
- Captures JavaScript errors automatically
- Can export error logs

## üéØ Most Likely Issues

### 1. Swapy Library Issue
- Swapy might not be compatible with Next.js 14
- Try the test-swapy page first
- If it fails, revert to @dnd-kit

### 2. Error Logger Issue
- The error logger might be causing problems
- Try accessing pages without the error logger
- Check if removing ErrorDisplay fixes the issue

### 3. Server-Side Rendering Issue
- Some components might not be SSR-compatible
- Check for `window` or `document` usage in components

### 4. Import/Dependency Issue
- Missing or incorrect imports
- Version conflicts between packages

## üöÄ Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Remove Error Logger Temporarily
```bash
# Comment out the ErrorDisplay in dashboard/page.tsx
# Rebuild and test
docker compose up -d --build web
```

### Fix 2: Revert to @dnd-kit
```bash
# Replace SwapyScheduleGrid with ScheduleGrid
# Remove Swapy imports
# Rebuild and test
```

### Fix 3: Check Browser Console
1. Open `http://localhost:3001/dashboard`
2. Press F12 to open developer tools
3. Look at Console tab for exact error message
4. Check Network tab for failed requests

## üìä Expected Results

### If Simple Test Works:
- Issue is with complex components (Swapy, error logger, etc.)
- Focus on component-specific debugging

### If Simple Test Fails:
- Issue is with basic setup (API, authentication, etc.)
- Check API connectivity and authentication

### If Minimal Dashboard Works:
- Issue is specifically with Swapy or error logger
- Test Swapy in isolation

### If All Tests Fail:
- Issue is with basic Next.js setup
- Check build process and dependencies

## üîç Next Steps

1. **Test each page in order** (simple-test ‚Üí minimal-dashboard ‚Üí test-swapy ‚Üí dashboard)
2. **Check browser console** for exact error messages
3. **Use debugging tools** to identify the root cause
4. **Apply appropriate fix** based on findings

## üìû Support Commands

```bash
# Full system check
./debug-logs.sh full-debug

# Real-time monitoring
./debug-logs.sh follow web

# Check specific service
./debug-logs.sh api 50
```
